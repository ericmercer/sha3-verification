A key aspect of this proof infrastructure is continuous checking, to ensure that properties remain proven during the lifetime of the software. At each change to the code, proofs are automatically re-established with little to no interaction from the developers. We describe the proof itself and the technical decisions that enabled integration into development.",

    abstract="The Software Analysis Workbench (SAW) is a system for translating programs into logical expressions, transforming these expressions, and using external reasoning tools (such as SAT and SMT solvers) to prove properties about them. In the implementation of this translation, SAW combines efficient symbolic execution techniques in a novel way. It has been used most extensively to prove that implementations of cryptographic algorithms are functionally equivalent to referencespecifications, but can also be used to identify inputs to programs that will lead to outputs with particular properties, and prove other properties about programs. In this paper, we describe the structure of the SAW system and present experimental results demonstrating the benefits of its implementation techniques.",

abstract = {Cryptol is programming a language designed for specifying and programming cryptographic algorithms. In order to meet high-assurance requirements, Cryptol comes with a suite of formal-methods based tools allowing users to perform various program verification tasks. In the fully automated mode, Cryptol uses modern off-the-shelf SAT and SMT solvers to perform verification in a push-button manner. In the manual mode, Cryptol produces Isabelle/HOL specifications that can be interactively verified using the Isabelle theorem prover. In this paper, we provide an overview of Cryptol's verification toolset, describing our experiences with building a practical programming environment with dedicated support for formal verification.},

abstract="The Software Analysis Workbench (SAW) is a verification tool that has shown promise in verifying cryptographic implementations in C and Java as evidenced by the verification of Amazon's s2n HMAC. That result uses an idealized abstraction for SHA256 to simplify the proof obligations. The OpenSSL SHA256 implementation supported by s2n presents verification problems for SAW because some functions do not complete SAW's symbolic execution or verification in the backend Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers. Fortunately, SAW provides a compositional framework to reduce the proof complexity, replacing function calls with overrides which are nothing more than contracts stating the input to output relation of the functions. This paper illustrates the SAW compositional framework applied to the OpenSSL SHA256 implementation. It shows a refactoring of the implementation that manages symbolic variables to work with the symbolic execution engine and lends itself to overrides while preserving its connection to the original source. Early results suggest the approach effective in applying SAW to legacy cryptographic implementations that are critical to the security of almost all existing applications.",
