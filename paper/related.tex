Our work built upon the SHA2-256 inner hash function verification (!--Citation1--).
Citation1 expanded the methodology by which Amazon's s2n HMAC was verified (!--Citation2--).
Both compared equivalent C and Cryptol specification through SAW.
While SHA3 is not implemented in s2n, Citation2 utilized both a high-level and low-level cryptol specification, similar to our work.
Citation1's verification of OpenSSL's SHA2-256 implementation served as a direct predecessor to our work.
While SHA2 is also part of NIST's Secure Hash Algorithms, it's internal structure differs vastly from the more complex and resistant SHA3.
